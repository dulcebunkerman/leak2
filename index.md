Salutations,

We hope this email finds you all well, as usual. Just reaching out to touch base on your projections for launching into Stage 2? We're running a little behind schedule over here, but we're looking to still meet the deadline from HQ, what about you guys? 

We're also having a little trouble in our trial runs with maintaining Protozoa-B survival through to incubation, got any tips? I know Friedemann was boasting about some sort of new method he'd developed, maybe that's something you could share?

Also, if you run into anyone from Gruppenseher 3 (I know you all rub elbows sometimes), tell them we thought the fires were a nice touch - and we'll have to try to one up them with our next cleanup.
